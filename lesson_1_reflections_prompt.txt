How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Since the diff tool reduces the amount of data to only the changes that have been made, it is a much lighter load for my mind to process for bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
1. Catching when and where a bug has occured.
2. Enables experimentation without worry.
3. Allows you to reference old code for current use.

Why do you think some version control systems, like git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It depends on the purpose. Code is often segmented into multiple files. Literature & images usually contain all relevant information in one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat can be used for a quick glance summary of changes between commits. Then, git diff can be used for a deeper investigation.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Breaking changes can always be undone by reverting to a known stable commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Maybe on my entry for lowrezjam2016.
