What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git folder with necessary information for the git version control system. This is where the commit data is stored.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
It's an intermediate step between the two. This way, you can add files on the fly without much thought. Then, when you go to commit, you can double-check to ensure that it is only one logical change.
