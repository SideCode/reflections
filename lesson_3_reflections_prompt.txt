When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're collaborating, or working from more than one location, or you want a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone you're collaborating with pushes into the remote, then you're goofed (And for push, you might be sharing confusing goof code if your code isn't ready).
